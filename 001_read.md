- Learn what trends would critically affect
  - are you sure?
- thereby requiring the organizations to constantly innovate and reinvent themselves.
  - depends on the needs, goals and current state

## Quality at Speed

- these organizations must consistently innovate and revamp themselves
  - why?
- through finding the solution to optimize practices and tools
  - ?
- to develop and deliver high-quality software quickly
  - ?
- Testing practices and tools need to evolve to address the challenges of achieving “Quality at Speed”
  - What does it mean?

## Agile and DevOps

- What does it mean exactly for Testing and Testers?

## Test Automation

- replace manual testing with automated testing
  - Is it possible to do so?
  - at a minimum, most regression testing should be automated...

## API and Services Test Automation

- When API and services are used across client applications and components, testing them is more effective and efficient than testing the client.
  - Why?

## Artificial Intelligence for Testing

- generate better test cases, test scripts, test data, and reports.

## Top Software Testing Trends in 2021

### Integration of Tools and Activities

- Base tools for integration exists many years (junit xml, plugins for Jenkins etc)
- Not the trend of exactly 2021

### Test Environments and Data

- High cohesion, testing system as as organic whole
- Fake data is not enough, real cases needed
- Virtual ephemeral QA env for each QA engineer

### Mobile Test Automation

- Low-tech is stil popular
  - Manual testing
  - Farm of real devices
  - Not my specialization

### Artificial Intelligence for Testing

- Is not mature enough to be considered

### API and Services Test Automation

- Professionals can kill by weapon / bare hands either
  - Know dedicated tools that are on hype, and pure opensource/ctandard/CLI ways as well

### Test Automation

- Developers try to steal functional tests and put it to it's unit tests
- TDD is fiction
  - Minor details of feature usually designed during implementation 
- Nobody argues :)

### Agile and DevOps

- Confirmed that AQA engineers has more and more DevOps tasks
  - Check resources provided by SUT by tools like Terraform
  - Design testing CI/CD flows
  - Testing CI/CD flows
- Agile is like radiation, it is everywhere, no needs to care specially about it
